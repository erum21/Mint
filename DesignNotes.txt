TODO next:
  -- The current "abs_outputs" property of builders needs to be cleaned up and recognized
     by the target manager. Perhaps 'outputs' shouldn't be a parameter.
  -- 'expectedType' in evaluator.
  -- add EnumType, and let options support enums.
  -- Think about scanners
    -- when do they run?
    -- how to parse the output
  -- required options.
  -- sort command-line options in help
  -- cross-configuration (configure on a platform other than the host.)
  -- kwargs, named args, default values - all that Python stuff.

Some more thoughts on gendeps:
  what we want is a dependency graph that looks like this:
    [object files in directory build(X)] -> generated deps file -> [source files in X]
  In other words, there's some build artifact that exists for each directory which has
    source files in it.
  A build rule wants to create an implicit dependency on this hypothetical deps object.
    so something like compose_unique(key, [protos]), where only one copy of the object is
    created for each unique value of 'key'.

TODO later:
  -- serialize configuration graph.
  -- load configuration graph.
  -- Trim leading space from multi-line string literals.
  -- String escaping.
