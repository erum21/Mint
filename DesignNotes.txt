TODO next:
  -- 'delete file' command
  'expectedType' in evaluator.
  -- add EnumType, and let options support enums.
  -- Get rid of GraphBuilder.
  -- Think about scanners
    -- when do they run?
    -- how to parse the output
  -- need a better syntax for combining arg lists. Varargs functions would help.

TODO later:
  -- compilers as linkers (clang and gcc)
  -- serialize configuration graph.
  -- load configuration graph.
  -- Trim leading space from multi-line string literals.
  -- String escaping.
  
We also need platform-specific file suffixes. (.o vs. .obj)

# Select either msvc or gcc based on the current host
